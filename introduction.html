        <h2>An Interactive Journey Through the JFK Assassination's Infinite Recursion</h2>
        
        <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--color-accent-gold); margin: 30px 0;">
        
        <p><strong>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was Ozzie Rabbit..."</strong></p>
        
        <p>Welcome, truth-seeker, to the labyrinth where certainty goes to die.</p>
        
        <p>You are about to enter a <strong>strange loop</strong>—Douglas Hofstadter's term for systems that fold back upon themselves, where seeking answers only generates more questions, where the very act of investigation becomes part of the mystery it attempts to solve.</p>
        
        <h3>The Theodicy Problem</h3>
        <p>Why do bad things happen to good people? Why do monumental events stem from seemingly trivial causes? The JFK assassination confronts us with what theologians call the problem of theodicy—the apparent randomness of suffering and significance in a world we desperately want to believe has meaning and order.</p>
        
        <h3>The Ostendorf Parallels: When Coincidence Becomes Cosmic</h3>
        <p>Lloyd Ostendorf discovered astonishing parallels between the Kennedy and Lincoln assassinations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lincoln elected to Congress in 1846; Kennedy in 1946</li>
            <li>Lincoln elected President in 1860; Kennedy in 1960</li>
            <li>Both shot on Friday, in presence of wives</li>
            <li>Both succeeded by men named Johnson</li>
            <li>Andrew Johnson born 1808; Lyndon Johnson born 1908</li>
            <li>Booth born 1839; Oswald born 1939</li>
            <li>Both assassins known by three names with 15 letters total</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Are we glimpsing hidden architecture of reality, or imposing meaning on meaningless coincidence?</p>
        
        <h3>Your Journey Through the Loops</h3>
        <p>You will navigate six interconnected loops, each examining the assassination from different perspectives. But here's the twist: <strong>your choices don't lead to "the truth"—they lead to deeper questions.</strong></p>
        
        <p>This is not a game you "win" by finding right answers. This is a game you complete by learning to ask better questions, by developing comfort with uncertainty.</p>
        
        <h3>A Warning and an Invitation</h3>
        <p>You are about to enter a space where facts become fluid, where evidence multiplies like reflections in facing mirrors. Some find this unsettling. Others find it liberating.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Welcome to the strange loop. Welcome to the place where certainty goes to die and something richer—though more uncomfortable—is born.</strong></p>
